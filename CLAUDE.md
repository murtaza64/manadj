This projet is a pre-pre-pre-alpha in active development. It has no users other than the developer. As such, BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY IS NOT A CONCERN.

this project is managed by uv.
to add requirements, use `uv add`.
to run scripts or modules, use `uv run path/to/script.py` or `uv run -m path.to.module`

this project does NOT prefer pastel colors as per my global theme, instead preferring bright, fully saturated colors
